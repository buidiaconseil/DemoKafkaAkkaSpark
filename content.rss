The firm founded by Thomas Edison has been a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a stockmarket index comprised of leading American companies, for over a century. Alas, mismanagement and a failure to move with the times have turned the erstwhile icon of innovation into a disorganised, debt-laden mess. GE\u2019s shares have plunged to below a quarter of their peak value in 2000. On June 26th GE was ejected from the Dow index and replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance, a big health-care firm.</p><p>Yet on that same day a ray of sunshine also fell on GE. John Flannery, an insider known for his number-crunching skills who took over as the troubled firm\u2019s boss last August, announced details of a much-awaited restructuring plan. Over the next couple of years GE will spin off its healthcare division and unwind its newish stake in Baker Hughes, a petroleum-services firm. He had previously confirmed the sale of...<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/news/business-and-finance/21745150-booted-dow-week-ge-becoming-humbler-fitter-john-flannery-gets-down?fsrc=rss\">Continue reading</a>]]></description>\n <author>The Economist online</author>\n <category domain=\"https://www.economist.com/category/site-sections/business-and-finance\">Business and finance</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.economist.com/taxonomy/term/76972\">Approved</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.economist.com/category/web-sections/business-and-finance\">Business and finance</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.economist.com/category/print-sections/business\">Business</category>\n <pubDate>Wed, 27 Jun 2018 16:37:47 +0000</pubDate>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">21745150 at https://www.economist.com</guid>\n</item>\n<item>\n <title><![CDATA[How two-wheelers are weaving their way into urban transport]]></title>\n <link>https://www.economist.com/news/business/21744866-electric-bikes-and-e-scooters-are-flummoxing-regulators-while-exciting-consumers-and-venture?fsrc=rss</link>\n <description><![CDATA[<p><div class=\"ec-content-image ec-thumbnail content-image-full\"><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20180623_WBP001_0.jpg\" class=\"ec-enlarge\"></a><img src=\"https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20180623_WBP001_0.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" width=\"1280\" style=\"height: auto\" /></div></p><p>THE streets of Beijing are thronged with two-wheeled contraptions. Some appear to be conventional petrol mopeds but as they zoom through red lights at pedestrian crossings their eerie silence and lack of exhaust reveals them as electric. Executives in suits cruise by on electric kick-scooters, looking like big kids on their way to school, though travelling much more enthusiastically. Electric bicycles, hacked together with a battery strapped to the frame and wired to a back-wheel hub containing a motor, crowd the edges of roads.</p><p>China\u2019s cities are at the forefront of a quiet swarm of electric two-wheeled vehicles. Millions now roam their centres. This transformation of urban mobility is also happening in the West, albeit with a notable addition that has yet to take off in China: firms that rent out electric kick-scooters.

It was one of just a few such firms focused on emerging markets, and a darling of \u201cimpact investors\u201d, who seek social or environmental returns, not just financial ones. Assets under management of $13.6bn made it the largest private-equity firm in the Middle East, and the 42nd-largest globally in 2017. Its Pakistani founder and boss, Arif Naqvi, a regular at Davos and a patron of the arts, had won awards for philanthropy. It is all the more surprising, then, that basic corporate-governance missteps led his firm to file for provisional liquidation on June 14th.</p><p>The problems began in late 2017 when four investors in its $1bn health-care fund, including the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the private-sector arm of the World Bank, grew worried. Nearly $280m of $545m they had been asked for was not promptly spent on acquisitions, as is standard in the industry.

The divide is not on points of grammar but on attitudes towards a handful of modish companies, known as FAANG. These stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) have been the motor of the S&amp;P 500 (see chart). All but Apple hit record highs on June 20th. Fill your boots is the attitude of coarse stockmarket berks. FAANG makes more sense than stocks in dying industries. For the prigs, the mania for FAANG stocks is as abhorrent as a split infinitive. The high-minded investor stands apart from the herd.</p><p>In matters of grammar, the unsure often follow the sticklers. They at least have rules. But they are often too rigid. Stockmarket sticklers can similarly lead others astray.

No one worried that tanks might soon roll as a result. But trade is about more than economics. The European Union, the world\u2019s most ambitious free-trade area, was founded on the idea that trade integration would make war between members \u201cnot merely unthinkable, but materially impossible\u201d. As the risk of a serious Sino-American trade war grows, attention is mostly focused on the prospect of dearer iPhones and unhappy soyabean farmers. But the stakes are much higher.</p><p>China\u2019s economic miracle could not help but provoke geopolitical stress, given its size and illiberality. Relations between America and China are built on mutual suspicion. Geopolitical rivalry has been moderated, however, by economic interdependence: a mutual entanglement some economics wags have dubbed \u201cChimerica\u201d.</p><p></p><p>As China opened up, American consumers hoovered up cheap Chinese goods.

Just over 20 years ago at the age of 23 he took a punt on Laurent Kabila, the rebel who in 1997 had just seized the Democratic Republic of Congo (then Zaire) from Mobutu Sese Seko, its dictator for the previous 32 years. Having met him through his son, Joseph, he lent the president $20m to buy weapons. He could have lost everything, but instead made it back a hundredfold. By the time Joseph Kabila took over from his father, after the latter\u2019s murder in 2001, he had become the man largely in charge of distributing Congo\u2019s mining licences to international mining companies.</p><p>Two decades on, Mr Gertler\u2019s clout in Congo is undiminished.
